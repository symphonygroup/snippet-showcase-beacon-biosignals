# SkilZTrakR
SkilZTrakR is an in-house project that Symphony develops for tracking employee's technical skills. The project has been started recently and is under active development. 

The application invites employees to self-assess their knowledge (1-5 stars grade) on particular skill-set (skill-set is administered by power users (admins/managers)). The managers are then able to filter out employees by particular skills/grades, and shortlist the best candidates for a position.

Daniel works on the FE part of the project.
